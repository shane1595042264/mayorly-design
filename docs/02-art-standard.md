# Mayorly art standard v0.1

**All art is hand-drawn, by the founder or by community artists. No AI-generated art, ever.**

One base unit: the **16x16 tile**. Every canvas is a whole multiple of it, which is what keeps atlas packing, collision, and camera zoom integer. The constraint is what lets a hundred artists produce art that looks like one game.

Live tool with a working validator: the `workshop/` repo.

## Classes

| class | canvas | frames | anchor | colours | used for |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `tile` | 16x16 | 1 | top left (0,0) | 16 | ground: grass, dirt, stone, path |
| `tile.anim` | 16x64 | 4, vertical strip | top left (0,0) | 16 | water, fire, anything that loops |
| `char` | 64x128 | 16, 4 dirs x 4 frames of 16x32 | feet (8,31) per cell | 24 | player and NPC walk sheets, two tiles tall like Stardew |
| `prop1x1` | 16x16 | 1 | bottom centre (8,15) | 20 | chests, lanterns, small decorations |
| `prop2x2` | 32x32 | 1 | bottom centre (16,31) | 24 | furniture the craftsman forges |
| `prop2x3` | 32x48 | 1 | bottom centre (16,47) | 24 | tall furniture, shelves, wardrobes |
| `prop2x4` | 32x64 | 1 | bottom centre (16,63) | 24 | showpiece furniture two tiles wide and four tall, the ledger shelf |
| `icon` | 16x16 | 1 | centre (8,8) | 12 | inventory and list row glyphs |
| `ui9` | 24x24 | 1 | 8px corners | 8 | nine slice panels and frames |
| `crop` | 16x64 | 4, vertical strip | bottom centre (8,15) | 16 | 4 stage growth from a ticked task |

## Camera and projection

Every sprite is drawn from the same imaginary camera: **in front of the object and a little above it.** This is the Stardew Valley view, and it is what makes props drawn weeks apart sit together.

- **Two sides are visible: the top and the front.** Never the left or right side. If you can see three faces, it is isometric, and isometric is wrong here.
- **Vertical edges stay vertical, horizontal edges stay horizontal.** Depth is never drawn as a diagonal.
- **The top surface is a compressed band along the top of the sprite,** about a third of the object's height for furniture. The front face is the rest. The desk sketch shows it: the light band with the journal on it is the top; the drawers are the front.
- **Depth reads through light, not geometry.** Key light from the upper left: top surface lightest, front face mid, a one-pixel shadow under the bottom edge and along the right.
- **Floor tiles are pure top view. Wall tiles are pure front view**, the vertical face of the north wall, which is why plaster only tiles sideways.
- **Characters face the camera when walking down** and are seen slightly from above, feet on the bottom row of the cell.
- **Characters are one tile wide and two tiles tall**, 16x32 per cell, the Stardew proportion. Head about a third of the height, the top three rows left clear so hats fit later. Tiles and props stay on the 16px base; only people are tall.

## Attachment points

Some props are containers the game fills at runtime. The ledger shelf is drawn empty and the game places up to nine `icon.ledger.closed` spines on it. So the shelf's slot file carries `bays`: rectangles, in canvas pixels, that belong to the game.

```
"bays": { "holds": "icon.ledger.closed", "spine": [6, 13], "perBay": 3,
          "rects": [[3, 7, 26, 15], [3, 24, 26, 15], [3, 41, 26, 15]] }
```

- **Inside a bay** the art is a flat back panel: fully opaque, at most 3 colours. The validator blocks on `bays.flat` otherwise, because a placed sprite sitting on top of detail shows that detail around its edges.
- **Outside the bays, every pixel is the artist's.** Crown, trim, posts, planks, plinth, a candle on top. Want a fatter frame? Shrink the bays in the slot file. Each must stay at least `perBay * spine.w + perBay + 1` wide and `spine.h + 1` tall (22x14 for the shelf), which `bays.fit` checks.
- **Placement rule the game follows:** spines are laid left to right, bottom aligned to the bay's bottom row, evenly spaced with `gap = floor((w - perBay * spine.w) / (perBay + 1))`. The rects ship in the manifest; the game never hardcodes them.
- The sketch shows the spines in accent yellow so you can see what the game will put there. Never draw them.

## Three tiers, not two

The real lesson from Minecraft is not the 16x16 grid, it is the **three-tier split** it enforces. Minecraft hard-enforces a small set of machine-checkable *structural* rules, **degrades loudly rather than failing** on quality rules, and leaves *aesthetics* entirely to convention plus tooling. That is what makes its ecosystem simultaneously consistent and enormous. Full evidence in [research/minecraft-art-standard.md](research/minecraft-art-standard.md).

| tier | what happens | examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Blocking** | rejected, never reaches a human | wrong canvas, soft alpha, over the colour cap, magenta sentinel present |
| **Warning** | accepted and shipped, but logged and shown to the reviewer | palette drift, unusually low fill, oversized outline |
| **Convention** | never checked, taught and reviewed by humans | light direction, silhouette, dithering, style |

Getting the middle tier wrong in either direction is the failure mode. Make everything blocking and contributors quit; make nothing blocking and quality drifts.

Two things Minecraft does that we explicitly do **not** copy: tolerance for off-size textures, and documented undefined behaviour on out-of-range values (its nine-slice `border >= 230` integer overflow is a bug it documents rather than fixes). We guard those.

## Blocking rules, enforced by the validator

A submission failing any of these is rejected before a human sees it.

1. **PNG only, RGBA or indexed.** Indexed with a transparent index is preferred: the scaffold ships that way with the master palette baked in, so off-palette colours cannot exist. RGB without alpha (a visible Background layer) and JPG are rejected.
2. **Binary alpha.** Every pixel is fully opaque or fully transparent. No soft edges, ever. Semi-transparent pixels break atlas bleeding and read as blur at 3x zoom.
3. **Exact canvas.** Not "about 16 wide". Exactly the size the slot names.
4. **Colour cap per class.** Counted as distinct RGB among **fully opaque pixels only**. A transparent pixel is not a colour, and the same RGB at two alpha values is not two colours. This rule is written down because the identical file passes or fails depending on it.
5. **Transparent pixels must be RGB `0,0,0`.** Stale colour data hiding under an alpha-0 pixel causes **coloured fringing at integer upscale**. It is invisible in Aseprite and obvious in the game, which is exactly why a machine has to catch it.
6. **`#FF00FF` never appears.** Magenta is the engine's missing-asset sentinel, drawn as a magenta and black checkerboard. Copied from Minecraft's missing texture for the same reason: shipping a gap must be impossible to miss.
7. **No embedded ICC profile.** sRGB is assumed. A colour profile silently shifts values between Aseprite and the browser and breaks exact palette matching.
8. **No baked shadow.** The engine draws contact shadows so lighting stays consistent. A painted shadow cannot be turned off.
9. **Frames are a vertical strip.** Frame 1 on top, height divides exactly by the frame count, no frame blank.

**Three of these are invisible to a canvas** and only exist because the validator parses the PNG bytes directly. The canvas 2D pipeline premultiplies alpha, so `getImageData` returns `0,0,0` for every alpha-0 pixel no matter what the file actually holds. A canvas-only check for stale RGB can never fail, which is worse than no check at all. Colour type and embedded ICC are likewise not exposed by canvas. The validator inflates `IDAT` and un-filters the scanlines itself.

**Aseprite exports are fine.** Validation runs in the browser on decoded RGBA, so an indexed PNG carrying transparency in a `tRNS` chunk passes. Naive server-side Pillow checks report mode `P` with no `A` and reject those legitimate exports. This is a real trap and the browser sidesteps it.

## Scale factors

Every canvas above is given at scale factor `S = 1`. A higher-resolution pack multiplies every pixel number by `S`, where **`S` is 1, 2 or 4 only**. Nothing in engine code may hardcode a pixel count; positions and sizes are expressed in tiles, so one set of layout data serves every `S`.

## Filenames are lowercase, and this is not cosmetic

`[a-z0-9_]` only, `/` as the sole separator, no spaces, no capitals. Minecraft mandated this in 1.11 because case-insensitive macOS and Windows filesystems diverge from case-sensitive Linux CI. It is a genuine class of bug that only appears once you have a build server.

## Warning rules, shipped but logged

Machines reject the boring failures for free so humans only spend attention on taste.

- 1px outlines maximum, darker than the fill rather than pure black.
- Light comes from the upper left. Every prop, no exceptions.
- No dithering below 2x2 blocks. It shimmers when the camera moves.
- Read the silhouette first. If it is unrecognisable as a solid black shape at 16x16, it will not read on the farm either.
- Stay in the game palette where you can. It is a guide, not a jail, and the validator only warns.

## Naming

```
<class>.<family>.<variant>[.<state>]        lowercase, snake_case, ascii only

prop1x1.chest.wooden.closed          a 16x16 prop, closed state
prop1x1.chest.wooden.open            the matching open state
prop2x2.furniture.oak_table          a 32x32 piece of furniture
char.craftsman.walk                  a 4-direction walk sheet
tile.terrain.grass_a                 variant a of the grass tile
crop.pumpkin.stages                  a 4-stage growth strip

file on disk:  <asset_id>@1x.png     one file, one slot, no exceptions
```

## Typography

From [research/pixel-fonts.md](research/pixel-fonts.md), fact-checked against the actual font binaries.

| role | font | licence |
|---|---|---|
| body, task rows, dates | **Pixel Operator** 16px | CC0 1.0 |
| headers, chest labels | Pixel Operator Bold 32px, or Silkscreen Bold 16px for short all-caps | CC0 / OFL 1.1 |

Pixel Operator is the only candidate that is simultaneously proportional, has true descenders, a slashed zero, smart punctuation, and a metrically identical bold.

**Set `line-height` explicitly.** Pixel Operator's default line box is 1.045em, not 1em, which knocks every baseline after the first off the pixel grid. Only the four 16px non-half-bold faces genuinely interchange; the Small Caps faces have no descenders and the 8px cut is a different design, not a scaled one.

## Third-party asset licensing

Two verified landmines from [research/art-asset-packs-and-licensing.md](research/art-asset-packs-and-licensing.md):

- The **free** tiers of Sprout Lands and Cozy Farm explicitly forbid commercial use. Verbatim: "can't be used in any commercial project, resold/redistributed, even if modified." Pay for premium.
- **Avoid Liberated Pixel Cup assets entirely.** CC-BY-SA 3.0 and GPL 3.0. Share-alike is exactly the trap for a closed-source paid app.

Safe for prototyping: Ninja Adventure (CC0) covers tileset, player, NPC, faces and UI on its own. Kenney Tiny Town and Tiny Farm are CC0.
